# Project-2 (To-do List)

## Technologies

HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap

## Description

A standard To-do list.

## Building the app

1. Start planning how I want the app to work and pseudocode it.
2. Get initial functions working(check user login etc).
3. Get all the routes and pages up and running.
4. Setup database tables and seeds for testing.
5. Allow users to edit/update uncompleted posts.
6. Allow users to sort the posts according to each category.

## MVP

* Ensure that user has to be logged in to access any page.
* Make certain pages unaccessible through directly typing in the route depending on the post.
* Make sure that urgent/completed posts look different from the rest.

## Further idea

* Have all the functions run smoothly within the same page.
* Allow users to create their own categories and choose colors for each category.
